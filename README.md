# 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea Project

This project involved adding animations to an existing static web page, an online reader of the book “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea” by Jules Verne.

## Objective

Use CSS transitions to make any interactions on the page smooth, specifically with:
* text on the table of contents;
* the "next" and "back" buttons;
* sliding of the sidebar;
* text color on the definable words; and
* sliding of the definition block.
